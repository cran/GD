Description: Geographical detectors for measuring spatial stratified heterogeneity,
             as described in Jinfeng Wang (2010) <doi:10.1080/13658810802443457> and 
             Jinfeng Wang (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052>. Includes the
             optimal discretization of continuous data, four primary functions of 
             geographical detectors, comparison of size effects of spatial unit and 
             the visualizations of results. To use the package and to refer the 
             descriptions of the package, methods and case datasets, please cite
